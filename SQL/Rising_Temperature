Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT today.Id
FROM   Weather as today
LEFT JOIN Weather as tomorrow
ON     DATEDIFF(today.Date, tomorrow.Date) = 1
WHERE  tomorrow.Temperature < today.Temperature
